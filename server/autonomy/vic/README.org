* Summary
  The vehicle control model contains the decision making for
  controlling the vehicle. We use the lane error, we got from the lane
  model, to proportionally control the steering and driving. The
  signs, we get from our sign detection model, are pushed to a queue
  and, handled by the drive controller. Currently, we are only
  reacting to stop signs. If a stop sign is detected, the drive
  controller outputs a drive value which stops the vehicle. The final
  drive and steering values, determined by the drive and steering
  controllers, are sent over I2C to the Arduino which maps the values
  to a pulse-width to control the steering servo and the Electronic
  Speed Controller for the drive motor.
