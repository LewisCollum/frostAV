#+title: FrostAV: Lane & Sign Detecting Tenth-Scale Vehicle
#+author: Lewis Collum

* Introduction
  Autonomous vehicles need to be able to follow a path, and react to
  environmental queues. The research that encompasses autonomous
  vehicles is not only useful for self-driving cars, but also within
  factory settings and places where transportation work can be
  automated.

  We 3D printed a vehicle, which holds a raspberry pi 4, Arduino, and
  a $5 USB camera, that is capable of following a lane and reacting to
  signs. This project demonstrates a real-time object detection
  network, a web server, and a lane detection system all
  simultaneously running on a $35 raspberry pi computer. In total,
  the cost of all parts on our vehicle is around $160.

* Conclusion & Necessary Improvements
  We demonstrated the ability for a low-cost, $35 Raspberry Pi 4, to
  run a web server, lane detection system, and sign detection
  system. The method we used for calculating lane error has edge cases
  which make it inaccurate, (such as if the vehicle is outside the
  lane lines). This method would need to be improve the reliability of
  the vehicle navigation. Our sign detection model runs at about 1
  frame-per-second, which would need to be increased (through
  optimizations) if we want the vehicle to travel faster. Increasing
  the speed of the vehicle now, generally results in a sign being
  missed.
