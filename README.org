** Getting Started
You do not need a vehicle to get started. As long as you have a
camera/webcam and a computer, you can run this application. This
project uses [[https://python-poetry.org/][Poetry]]. To run the application
#+begin_src bash
  poetry install
  poetry run
#+end_src

Now in your browser, go to =localhost:5000=. If you have a camera
available (at =/dev/video0=) then you should see a livestream of the
camera. You can play around with the annotations provided in the
drop-down. For example, clicking the "signs" annotation will show a
box around detected signs (try holding a "stop" sign phone image in
front of the camera to see). Lane lines can be detected if you have
blue painter's tape held up to the camera (you may need to calibrate
the colors in code due to camera settings).

** I2C Communication
If you are running the application on a board that has i2c (e.g. RPi)
then install =smbus2= and the application will attempt to write JSON
steering and drive values to address =0x32=
#+begin_src bash
  poetry add smbus2
#+end_src
