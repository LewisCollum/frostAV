*** Power Supply (Designed by [[https://github.com/ishelly404][Ian Shelly]])
Designed in KiCad, this power supply is meant to step down a *7.4V LiPo battery* to *5V*. It can output up to at least *3.5A*. In order to conveniently power USB devices (such as a Raspberry Pi), it has a 5V USB output socket.

*** Frost Schematic (Designed by [[https://github.com/ishelly404][Ian Shelly]])
The main components on Frost include the Raspberry Pi 4, Arduino, OLED status display, and power supply. We also included an optional remote fail-safe switch that uses an XBee transmitter and receiver.

*** 3D Printed Chassis
The chassis is a remix of OpenRC on Thingiverse. Here is the most recent set of parts printed for mounting the Raspberry Pi, powersupply, and camera.
